              <h3>Writing website in free time</h3>
              <p>I spent my after-school hours learning HTML and CSS,and I even attempted to create my own website.To develop a website,I must use imagination and strategy to construct a website according to plan,as well as always learn new approaches because it is a language I have never studied before,and I am determined.My time has been invested in creating this website so that the public may better comprehend and get to know me.And I'd want to thank everyone who came to view my work.I am quite pleased of this work since I did everything myself,despite the fact that no one instructed me,and I researched it until I was able to accomplish it.Moreover,I'm planing to do a music in my website but I'm learning and find the way to do it.

              <h3>NEW WATER FACTORY AT SINGAPORE</h3>
              <p>I went to a wastewater treatment facility in Singapore where the wastewater must first go through pre-filtration before being sent by a powerful pump to the groundwork for additional processing to proceed with the treatment in the following stage,which involves cleaning to get rid of numerous infections.With a cutting-edge filtration technique that includes sterilizing by ultraviolet radiation,both bacteria and viruses can be removed.Although the output can be consumed with water,industrial operations primarily use it.

              <h3>BEST POPULAR PLACE IN SINGAPORE</h3>
              <p>I've visited a lot of locations in Singapore and have seen its beauty,cultural diversity,and advancement.I have traveled around Singapore.Singapore is a lovely,clean nation with no litter on the streets and the route will be lined by choked trees,making it appear picturesque and tranquil.This leads me to believe that our nation will advance if we implement diverse restrictions.And I'm having a great time on this tour.</p>
